# Food-Delivery-Time-Pediction
In the fast-paced food delivery industry, accurately predicting delivery times is essential for enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing operational efficiency. This project focuses on developing a predictive model that estimates the time required for food delivery from the restaurant to the customerâ€™s location.

The project begins by collecting and analyzing data from various sources, including order details, delivery locations, restaurant preparation times, traffic conditions, and weather data. The dataset is then pre-processed to clean and organize the information, handling missing values and normalizing the data for consistency.

Several machine learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting, are explored to create a predictive model. The model is trained on historical data, learning patterns and correlations that influence delivery times. Factors such as distance, order size, and time of day are considered to improve the accuracy of the predictions.

Feature engineering is employed to extract relevant features from the data, such as average preparation time, delivery route efficiency, and real-time traffic conditions. These features are crucial for refining the model and enhancing its predictive power.

The project also involves hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and its ability to generalize across different scenarios. The final model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure its accuracy.

Results are presented through dashboards and visualizations, allowing restaurants and delivery platforms to anticipate delivery times more accurately. This information can be used to inform customers, adjust delivery strategies, and improve overall service efficiency.

Ultimately, this project demonstrates the potential of data-driven approaches in the food delivery industry, providing valuable insights that can lead to better customer experiences and more efficient operations.
